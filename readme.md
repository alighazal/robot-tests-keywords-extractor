# Robot tests Keyword Extractor

the aim of this project is to help you easily find where keywords are defined in .robot files. vs code extentions could help with this, however, for some reasons it wasn't working on the custom defined tests in the environment i was working in. Also, doing a simple file search will give you a list of all places where the keyword was used (not where it is defined). thus, the purpose of this python script is to go through all the robot files in your environment and list where keywords are defined. 

Later, i might add a visualization to help users search through keywords, their locations, and thier definitions.
